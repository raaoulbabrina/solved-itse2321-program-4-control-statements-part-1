The owners of the Annan Supermarket would like to have a program that computes the weekly gross pay of their employees. The user will enter an employee’s ID number, the hourly rate of pay, and the number of hours worked for the week.  In addition, Annan Supermarkets would like the program to compute the employee’s net pay and overtime pay. <strong>Overtime hours, any hours over</strong> <strong>40, are paid at 1.5 the regular hourly rate.</strong>  Net pay is Gross minus deductions. Assume that deductions are made up of income tax (at 10.5% of gross if the gross exceeds $600.00) and a $25 parking charge. Use class Scanner to input the user’s data.




The output will look like this:
